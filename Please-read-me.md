Apologies for the unfinished "How to scan" box in the main page. I was unable to finish it due to lack of time. 
I didn't remove it to keep the aesthetic/ look of the main page. 

The scanner currently scans any valid QR codes (initially, was supposed to scan barcodes too but I also couldn't finish it in time
so the idea changed slightly).
After databases, we plan to generate and keep 3 specific QR codes (for plastic, paper and glass packaging), which the scanner would recognise only.
(If the webapp was to function in the real world, we would put them on packaging of products we recognise and give points for).
The end
